# VonApalussoPoodleKennel
Backend part of app done in c#, Visual studio 2022
trying to organize my poodle kennel a bit 
using basic backend c# knowledge to work on my project. Will work on adding base crud operations, with authentication and authorization model using Entity farmework identity.
Plan is to expand project to something more deeper and complicated(getting involved into poodle database, so i will need authorization and authentication model for that).
Will add on front end part for presentatiion using reactJS 
Backend code is private, and front end still not optimised for mobile usage.
